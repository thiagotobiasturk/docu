Suggestions for Standard Resource Structure
What Copilot does:
 When you start writing a resource, variable, provider, or output block, Copilot detects the pattern and automatically suggests a complete structure based on best practices or official documentation.
Benefits:
Saves time writing resources from scratch


Reduces syntax errors


Acts as a learning aid for beginners
Example:
If you write:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0500fc19-e63e-4a73-8d5d-89896800170e)

Copilot might suggest:

More Descriptive and Consistent Variable Names
What Copilot does:
 It recommends variable, resource, and output names based on project context and naming best practices. This improves readability and maintainability.
Benefits:
Promotes team-wide consistency


Avoids generic or confusing names


Improves documentation of code intent


Example:
Instead of writing:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/545ea399-6ad3-4129-899d-bba64cc22de6)

Copilot may suggest:

Quick Generation of Reusable Module Blocks
What Copilot does:
 When you start writing a module block, Copilot suggests commonly used parameters. For well-known modules (like those from the Terraform Registry), Copilot often “knows” the expected structure.
Benefits:
Speeds up integration of complex modules


Minimizes mistakes with incorrect inputs


Encourages reusable infrastructure-as-code


Example:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9bdf9c1-acaf-4221-9a3a-91fe041e7d94)

Copilot can auto-complete this based on the module source.

Automatic Generation of Helpful Comments
What Copilot does:
 It detects your code and suggests natural language comments explaining what the block does.
Benefits:
Enhances in-code documentation


Helps collaborators understand and maintain infrastructure


Great for multi-team or onboarding scenarios


Example:

These comments can be automatically suggested by Copilot.
